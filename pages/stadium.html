                        The stadium replaced Barcelona’s previous ground Camp de les Corts, which, though it could hold 60,000 supporters, was still too small for the growing support of the club.
                        
                        Camp Nou initially consisted of two tiers that could hold 93,000 spectators. It was first called Estadi del FC Barcelona, but got soon referred to as Camp Nou.
                        
                        The stadium was, together with Estadio Santiago Bernabeu, playing venue of the Euro 1964 Championships.

                        In 1943, Chamartin had already become too small again, and club-president Santiago Bernabéu decided that Madrid needed a new and modern 100,000-stadium.
                        
                        This new stadium got built at the same site of Campo de Chamartín. Construction began in 1945, and on the 14th of December 1947 Estadio Santiago Bernabéu officially opened with a match against Portuguese champions OS Belenenses (3-1).
                        
                        The stadium was initially still called Nuevo Estadio Chamartin, but received the name of the club-president eight years later.</p>

                        Parc des Princes was officially opened on 4 June 1972 by French president Georges Pompidou. The first match was the Coupe de France final between Marseille and Bastia (2-1).
                        
                        The stadium, designed by architect Roger Taillibert, was lauded for its avant garde design and received several architectural prices. Its most striking feature were the 50 concrete columns that support the ring-shaped roof.
                        
                        One year after the opening, in 1973, newly founded Paris Saint-Germain moved into the stadium.</p>
